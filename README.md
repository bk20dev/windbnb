<!-- Introduce your projects by taking a screenshot or a gif. Try to tell visitors a story about your project by answering: -->

This is my first bigger (and completed!) project with React.

I have started learning React at the beginning of this year. However. I didn't have enough time to learn it. Finally, during this summer I have completed an online course I was given on Christmas. And now it is the time for practice!

By completing this project, I have consolidated my current skills and learned how to deploy a React app. Also, I have noticed, I am not good at organizing my code together with the file structure. And this is something I will be working on.

I can't wait to do more projects like this ðŸ˜Š
